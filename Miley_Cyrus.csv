Breakout,Breakout,2008,"Every weeks the same.
Stuck in school's so lame.
My parents say that I'm lazy.
Getting up at 8 AM's crazy.
.
Tired of being told what to do.
So unfair.
So uncool.
.
The day's too long.
And I'm holding on.
'til I hear the bell ring.
.
'cause that's time when we're gonna.
(Time when we're gonna).
.
[Chorus:].
Breakout.
Let the party start.
We're gonna stay out.
Gonna break some hearts.
We're gonna dance till the dance floor falls apart.
Uh oh, all over again..
We're gonna wake up everyone we know.
We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control.
Feels so good, to let go-oh-oh..
.
Hangin' out's just somethin' we like to do.
My friends and the mess we get into.
These are the lessons that we choose.
Not a book full of things we'll never use.
.
[Chorus].
.
I wish it would never end,.
Spending time with my friends..
Oh with my friends!",No.
7 Things,Breakout,2008,"I probably shouldn't say this.
But at times I get so scared.
When I think about the previous.
Relationship we've shared.
.
It was awesome.
But we lost it.
It's not possible.
For me not to care.
.
And now we're standing in the rain.
But nothing's ever gonna change.
Until you hear.
My dear.
.
The 7 things I hate about you.
The 7 things I hate about you (oh you).
.
You're vain, your games, you're insecure.
You love me, you like her.
You make me laugh, you make me cry.
I don't know which side to buy.
.
Your friends they're jerks.
When you act like them.
Just know it hurts.
.
I wanna be with the one I know.
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do.
You make me love you.
.
It's awkward and silent.
As I wait for you to say.
But what I need to hear now.
Is your sincere apology.
.
When you mean it.
I'll believe it.
If you text it.
I'll delete it.
.
Let's be clear.
Oh I'm not coming back.
You're taking 7 steps here.
.
The 7 things I hate about you.
.
You're vain, your games, you're insecure.
You love me, you like her.
You make me laugh, you make me cry.
I don't know which side to buy.
.
Your friends they're jerks.
When you act like them.
Just know it hurts.
.
I wanna be with the one I know.
And the 7th thing I hate the most that you do.
You make me love you.
.
And compared to all the great things.
That would take too long to write.
I probably should mention.
The 7 that I like.
.
The 7 things I like about you.
.
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's.
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized.
You make me laugh, you make me cry.
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy.
.
Your hand in mine.
When we're intertwined.
Everything's alright.
.
I want to be with the one I know.
And the 7th thing I like the most that you do.
You make me love you.
You do",No.
The Driveway,Breakout,2008,"After twelve.
Not so well.
Won't pretend, it's too soon to tell.
What's around this bend?.
.
No disgrace.
About face.
Anything not to have to chase.
You down again.
.
You know nothing hurts like losing.
When you know it's really gone.
Except for the pain of choosing.
To hold too long.
.
I tried it your way.
But I got nothing to show.
It's been the same, same.
And the story's getting old.
So I guess the driveway.
Will be the end of the road.
For us it's too late.
Let the credits start to roll.
.
A lot to say.
But not today.
Let the radio break the silence.
As we drive.
.
A kiss goodbye.
Not this time.
Don't remember what about this song.
I ever liked.
.
You know nothing hurts like losing.
When you know I'm already gone.
Except for the pain of choosing.
To hold too long.
.
I tried it your way.
But I got nothing to show.
It's been the same, same.
And the story's getting old.
So I guess the driveway.
Will be the end of the road.
For us it's too late.
Let the credits start to roll.
.
I thought maybe we were getting somewhere.
But we're still nowhere at all.
I watch your tail lights fading.
I try but a tear won't fall.
.
I remember what it feels like to know love.
And have it taken away.
Can't think of what I've learned right now.
But I'll be thanking you someday.
.
I tried it your way.
But I got nothing to show.
You know it's been the same, same.
And the story's getting old.
So I guess the driveway.
Will be the end of the road.
For us it's too late.
Let the credits start to roll.
.
Let the credits start to roll.
So I guess the driveway.
Will be the end of the road.
Be the end of the road.
.
Will be the end of the road.
Be the end of the road",No.

Full Circle,Breakout,2008,"I've been in a rut.
Back and forth enough.
Heart like a wheel.
Without you around.
So uncomfortable is how it feels.
.
Every time you're near.
Trouble disappears.
Under the ground.
But when you go to far.
Silver clouds will start hanging around.

And I know why.
Tried to run.

How long can I last.
Please let me know.
Where's the finish line.
'Cause I've got to find somewhere to go.

I don't want to hear.
People interfere.
What do they know.
What I feel inside.
When I'm up all night.
Needing you home.

Fly On The Wall,Breakout,2008,"You don't understand what it is.
That makes me tick.
But you wish you did.
You always second guess,wonder if i say yes.
but you just lose out every time.
.
If you only knew what i talked about.
When I'm with my friends just hangin' out.
Then you'd have the inside scoop.
On what to say, what to do.
That way when you play the game.
Baby you could never lose.

Bottom Of The Ocean,Breakout,2008,"It's been in the past for a while.
I get a flash and I smile.
Am I crazy?.
Still miss you baby.

But it burned too hot to survive.
All that's left is.

What I'm missing.
I'll keep re-living.

Four Walls,Breakout,2008,"These four walls.
They whisper to me.
They know a secret.
I knew they would not keep.
It didn't take long.
For the room to fill with dust.
And these four walls came down around us.
.
It must have been something to send me out of my head.
With the words so radical and not what I meant.
Now I wait.
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left.
Just me and these four walls again.
.
It's hard now to let you be.
I won't make excuses.
I've made my peace.
It didn't take long.
For me to lose the trust.
'Cause these four walls.
Were not strong enough.

It must have been something to send me out of my head.
With the words so radical and not what I meant.
Now I wait.
For a break in the silence 'cause it's all that you left.
Just me and these four walls again.

Yeah.
It's difficult.
Watching us fade.
Knowing it's all my fault.
My mistake.
Yeah, and it's difficult.

Knowing it's all my fault.

Simple Song,Breakout,2008,"Wake up.
Here I go.
Cram it all down my throat.
Stomach's so full.
That I wish I could choke.
7 A.M. my head's.
Already in a spin.
As soon as I'm out that door.
Bam.
It hits me like a ton of those red bricks.
Can't dig myself out of this.
Highest ditch.
This madness.

Which way is down.

Sun beatin' on the concrete.
Burnin' up my feet.
Too many cars on the street.
The noise.
The red.
The green.
Makes me wanna scream.
It's 5 o'clock.
Now it's bumper on bumper on bumper.
Horn's honkin'.
Nobody's lookin' but everybody's talkin'.
Just another day.
On this highway.

Which way is down.

Goodbye,Breakout,2008,"I can honestly say.
You've been on my mind.
Since I woke up today.
I look at your photograph all the time.
These memories come back to life.
And I don't mind.
.
I remember when we kissed.
I still feel it on my lips.
The time that you danced with me.
With no music playing.
I remember the simple things.
I remember till I cry.
But the one thing I wish I'd forget.
The memory I wanna forget.
Is goodbye.
.
I woke up this morning.
And played our song.
And through my tears I sang along.
I picked up the phone and then.
Put it down.
'cause I know I'm wasting my time.
And I don't mind.
.
I remember when we kissed.
I still feel it on my lips.
The time that you danced with me.
With no music playing.
I remember the simple things.
I remember till I cry.
But the one thing I wish I'd forget.
The memory I wanna forget.
.
Suddenly my cell phone's blowing up.
With your ring tone.
I hesitate but answer it anyway.
You sound so alone.
And I'm surprised to hear you say.
.
You remember when we kissed.
You still feel it on your lips.
The time that you danced with me.
With no music playing.
You remember the simple things.
We talk till we cry.
You said that your biggest regret.
The one thing you wish I'd forget.
Is saying goodbye.

Looking out the window it just rained.
But the sun's up for the day.
And there's probably a rainbow.
But I don't care.
Cause all the colors left with you.
Thinking about driving around in your car.
I never thought that we would take it very far.
I just love talking, and then parking.
Then we go walking.
I loved you so much.
I just started watching TV.
I get so high cause you're not here smoking my weed.
And I get so bored.
Cause you're not here to make me laugh.
You're so cute.
In your space suit.
In your space boots.
Space dude.
Since you've left I've started to drink.
Sometimes when I do drugs I'll start to overthink.
And I start crying.
I think I'm dying.
But I'm just tripping spiraling down this hole.
.
Oh space dude in your space boots.
I got to be high to deal with your moods.
But maybe it's me and I got to change my views.
Oh space dude in your space suit.
Our love it takes us to the moon.
But you leave me up there I'm so maroon.

.
Every time we talk I feel like shit.
I guess I was just tryin' to avoid letting myself feel like this.
Cause it makes me feel like I might die.
But every second I'm doing that anyway.
My biggest fear is not being with you.
The pain is so excruciating I don't know what I'd do.
We're both vegan.
It makes it easy to think it never hurt anything.
Living intentionally.

Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude.
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe.
And it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall right back out again.
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures.
But I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place.
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that,.
I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be.
And you know, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know what?.
Haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess.
.
You're giving me a feeling in my head.
Laying in my bed just thinking.
Not really feeling like the one I want.
Takes everything in me not to call him.
I really, really, really wanted to.
I told all my friends I'm moving on.
Your baby talk is creeping me out.
Fuck me so you stop baby talking.
.
You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit.
And then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat.
I mean, even in front of your mom.
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough.
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch.
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do.
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but you know what I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo.
.
You keep saying again and again.
We're laying in my bed just talking.
And now I, know I can't hold it back.
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit.
I don't really want an older you.
I heard I change my mind way too often.
Baby talk is creeping me out.
Fuck me so you stop baby talking.
.
Alright so, I'm gonna be honest.
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here.
I mean, I'm fucking what?.
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know,.
The ones with the, the hands over the eyes, that means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me.
I mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just like bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth.
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do.
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute, oh, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world, some.
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck.
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit.
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo.
